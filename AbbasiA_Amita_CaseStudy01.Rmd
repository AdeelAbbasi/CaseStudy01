## CASE STUDY 01 - October 18

### Description

The Beers dataset contains a list of 2410 US craft beers and Breweries dataset contains 558 US breweries. The datasets descriptions are as follows

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

```{r}

library('dplyr')
library('ggplot2')
library('kableExtra')
library('grid')
# Load the CSV files into a variable


Breweries <- read.csv("Breweries.csv")
Beers     <- read.csv("Beers.csv")

# Rename the coolumn name

names(Breweries)[2] <- 'Brewery Name'
names(Beers)[1] <- 'Beer Name'

data <- Breweries %>% group_by(State) %>% summarize(Count = n())


```

Generate the plot, group by state

Graph shows the Colorado, Califorina and Michigan has the highest number of Breweries

 plot(MergedData$IBU, MergedData$ABV, pch = 148, col = c('Red', 'Green'), xlab = "I B U", ylab = "A B V", main = "")
grid.text("(Figure 4)", 0.88, 0.88)

# Examination of this scatter plot and the regression line suggests that there is a positive, linear relationship between `IBU` and `ABV`.


```

## Review and Conclusion

In this analysis, we examined data gleaned from two datasets regarding beers and breweries throughout the US. We examined the structure of this data, cleaned them, and combined them. We then performed various analyses, such as calculating median values for IBU and ABV by state, and determining which states had the beers with the highest ABV and IBU values. We finished by looking for a potential relationship between IBU and ABV, and found that there is evidence to suggest that a positive correlation exists between the two.
